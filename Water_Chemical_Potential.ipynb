The main difference is that my python code works taking arguments from the execution line. These arguments define the names of the input and output files, and also define the sigma value for the gaussian normalization of the distribution of water molecules.\n",

The whole program is oriented to the obtaining of this array and to the execution of the writeVoxels function."

Then, we filter all atoms of oxygen belonging to a molecule of water and we count the number of molecules of water that we have in the simulation considering all frames. Then, we iterate over all the frames, and inside of it we iterate for all oxygen atoms. For each oxygen atom we get it's coordinates, we round them and we add one to the value in the multidimensional array corresponding with the specified coordinates of the atom. For a proper performance, the matrix has to be big enough so all atoms of oxygen in the box should be included. However, negative values are not included as coordinates, that's why we move the whole molecule to a possitive quadrant. Just in case we have some unexpected molecule of water in negative or non considered coordinates, we have a warning comand that will inform us in case that this happens. Finally, the function returns the three dimension array and the number of molecules of water of the whole simulation."
